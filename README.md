# Challenge-1
## Horiseon Refactor
In this project I was tasked with refactoring the HTML and CSS code that made up the marketing agency Horiseon's landing page. Horiseon requested that the landing page follow accessibility standards for search engine optimization. I refactored the code to resemble the given acceptance criteria. 
1. I edited existing HTML elements so that the source code followed semantic HTML.
2. I structured the HTML elements logically independant of styling and positioning.  
3. Icon and image elements were given accessible alt attributes.
4. Heading attributes were aligned to fall in sequential order.
5. The title element was edited to be more descriptive.
6. CSS was edited to represent the HTML element changes.
